`notex.cls` defines a series of behavior based on `amsart` class.

* Sections are now rearranged as Problems, while the Appendix remains the same.
* Builtin environment for Problem, Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, Definition, and more.
* `\title` is not necessarily defined. Instead, a variable named `lecture` gives you the option to directly input the 'number' of the lecture. The title will then be automatically formulated as `Lecture #{psetnum}`.
